import * as fmt from 'show-episode-format';

fmt.formatEpisode(1, 1) //=> '01x01'
fmt.formatEpisode({ season: 1, episode: 2 }) //=> '01x02'

fmt.formatEpisodeRelease(1, 4) //=> 's01e04'
fmt.formatEpisodeRelease({ season: 1, episode: 5 }) //=> 's01e05'

fmt.isEqual([1, 1], [1, 1]) //=> true
fmt.isEqual([1, 1], [1, 2]) //=> false
